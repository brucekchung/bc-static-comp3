A Turing project.  This was the final static comp of Mod1, and it was a large step up in complexity in comparison to Static comp 1 and 2.  The original comp has a serious and businesslike demeanor, and I made my adaption to have the appearance of an older government featuring a jet fighter.  I added a hover state on the image to satisfy the graph requirement and as a running joke with the instructors.

I've added three media queries so the comp can collapse all the way down to a media size screen and remain well-structured.  Most of the comp was constructed using Flex or standard CSS.
